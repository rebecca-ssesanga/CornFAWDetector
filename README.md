## üì± Overview
**Corn FAW Detector** is a mobile application developed as part of a Master's research project to tackle the critical issue of Fall Armyworm (FAW) infestations in maize crops. The app uses a lightweight, efficient deep learning model to detect FAW damage from maize leaf images, enabling faster, more accurate field-level pest diagnosis.

## üß† Problem Statement
- Early detection of FAW infestation is essential for effective pest management and crop health.
- Traditional inspection methods are slow, expensive, and prone to human error.
- There's a growing need for scalable, low-cost, tech-driven tools for real-time field diagnosis.

## üéØ Objectives
- Curate a dataset of **2,868** maize leaf images (healthy vs FAW-damaged).
- Evaluate and compare CNN models including **VGG16**, **MobileNetV2**, and **InceptionV3**.
- Measure performance using the **F1 Score** from the confusion matrix.
- Deploy the best-performing model in an Android application for real-world use.

## üîß Methodology
- üì∏ **Data Collection:** Sourced from an ongoing agricultural research project in Uganda.
- üßπ **Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
- üß™ **Model Training:** Used transfer learning on multiple CNN architectures.
- üì≤ **Deployment:** Integrated the best model (MobileNetV2) using **TensorFlow Lite** into an Android app using Java.

## üöÄ Results
- **MobileNetV2** achieved:
  - üü¢ **Training Accuracy:** 99.87%
  - üß™ **Test Accuracy:** 99.65%
  - üèÜ **F1 Score:** 1.00
- Real-world testing on 300 maize leaves showed robust accuracy and reliability under different conditions.

## üß™ Field Testing
- Tested on diverse maize samples across varying lighting and weather conditions.
- Compatible with different Android cameras.
- Positive user feedback on usability and real-time prediction.

## üìâ Limitations
- Extended training time and training interruptions.
- Occasional **false negatives**.
- **Overfitting** observed in the InceptionV3 model during experimentation.

## üí° Recommendations
- Hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting.
- Integrate regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization.
- Conduct further testing during all maize growth stages for better generalization.

## üîÆ Future Work
- Annotate FAW-affected regions in images to improve model localization.
- Expand dataset to include other crop types and pests.
- Explore **ensemble learning** or hybrid CNN models for higher accuracy.
